Hand Gesture Game Controller

This project allows you to control games such as CS2 using hand gestures detected through your webcam. It uses OpenCV, cvzoneâ€™s HandTrackingModule, and pynput to map hand gestures to keyboard and mouse inputs.

Features

Detects hand gestures via webcam.

Maps gestures to keyboard inputs for controlling movement.

Supports mouse clicks for in-game actions.

Exit gesture to close the program safely.

Requirements

Python 3.x

OpenCV

cvzone

pynput

Install dependencies with:

pip install opencv-python cvzone pynput

How to Run

Clone this repository.

Ensure your webcam is connected.

Run the script:

python hand_gesture_controller.py


Use the defined hand gestures to control your game.

Notes

The detection works best in a well-lit environment.

Some games may require running the script with administrator permissions to allow simulated key presses.

Gesture recognition depends on webcam quality and hand visibility.
