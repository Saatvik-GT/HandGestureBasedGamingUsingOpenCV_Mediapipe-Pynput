# Hand Gesture Game Controller  

This project allows you to control games such as CS2 using hand gestures detected through your webcam. It uses OpenCV, cvzoneâ€™s HandTrackingModule, and pynput to map hand gestures to keyboard and mouse inputs.  

## Features  

1. Detects hand gestures via webcam.  
2. Maps gestures to keyboard inputs for controlling movement.  
3. Supports mouse clicks for in-game actions.  
4. Exit gesture to close the program safely.  

## Gesture Mappings  

| Gesture                        | Action              |  
|--------------------------------|---------------------|  
| Index finger up                | Press and hold W    |  
| Index and middle fingers up    | Press and hold S    |  
| Thumb up                       | Press and hold A    |  
| Index, middle, and ring up     | Press and hold D    |  
| Fist (all fingers down)        | Left mouse click    |  
| Open palm (all fingers up)     | Exit the program    |  

## Requirements  

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- cvzone  
- pynput  

Install dependencies with:  
```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone pynput
```  

## How to Run  

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Ensure your webcam is connected.  
3. Run the script:  
```bash
python hand_gesture_controller.py
```  
4. Use the defined hand gestures to control your game.  

## Notes  

- The detection works best in a well-lit environment.  
- Some games may require running the script with administrator permissions to allow simulated key presses.  
- Gesture recognition depends on webcam quality and hand visibility.
